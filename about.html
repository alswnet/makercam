	<h3>A flash-based 2.5d CAM and nesting program that outputs standard G-Code for use in CNC fabrication devices.</h3>
	features:
	<ul>
		<li>- arbitrary profiles, pockets, and drilling operations</li>
		<li>- true shape nesting</li>
		<li>- automatic island detection</li>
		<li>- sketch-to-CAD tool for easy prototyping</li>
		<li>- svg import and export</li>
	</ul>
	</br>

		MakerCAM is an attempt to revitalize the fantastic project by Jack Quio, named PartKam. Jack created PartKam in 2009 as a thank you to the community at cnczone.com. Not getting much attention or the appreciation it deserved, Jack open sourced the
		project before moving on to bigger and better things. Thanks to Jack's fantastic base, we have a great starting point to implement some new features, clean up the UI (it doesn't need much!) and possibly port it over to HTML5.
		</br>
		</br>
		As is MakerCAM is in beta stage and needs to be treated as such. Although most all of the features are working predictably, please test all generated gcode in a simulator (such as gview) prior to running on your actual machine. We make no
		guarantees the code is usable or that you won't hurt yourself or your machine trying to run it. <b>Use this program at your own risk!</b>

		<b>What:</b>
		MakerCAM is a web based CAM program. Simple by design, MakerCAM allows you to produce toolpaths for use with 3 axis CNC machines such as Shapeoko, Probotics, Zenworks CNC, ShopBot, or any other 3 axis machine that accepts standard RS274D gcode
		(most hobby/small business CNC machines accept this.)
		</br></br>

		<b>Why:</b>
		<ul>
			<li>- There are thousands of people out in the wild with working CNC machines.</li>
			<li>- DIY or purchasing - a high quality, low cost CNC machine is less difficult to get now than it has ever been in the history of civilization.</li>
			<li>- Getting the machine is the easy part. Creating your own parts is the hurdle.</li>
			<li>- CAD -> CAM -> Simulating -> Streaming -> Operating</li>
		</ul>

		<b>How:</b>
		<ol>
			<li> In browser drawing - a set of simple shapes are provided. You can find them through the 'insert' menu.</li>
			<li> Importing SVG file (from inkscape or browse images.google.com)</li>
		</ol>
		<b>Now What:</b>
		<p>
			We're working on a getting started with your <a href="tutorial.html">first project page</a>, and a <a href="help.html">verbose help section</a> to get everyone up to speed.
